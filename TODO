# Bugs:
 - cart logs just not showing up
 - import will create seemingly 'duplicate' items
 - search database for existing similar items?
 - when running through items in cart log, some DOCS w/ name, quantity, price DONT have any id
   - try to search the database with an item close to that name
   - fill in the id for that log
 - purchasing an item a second time will override current quantity in cartLogs
