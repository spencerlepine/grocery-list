- duplicates in recommended
- keep track of the loading for Groceries, Cart, and recommended
- USE PARAMETERS WHERE THINGS DON"T TAKE BODY

- finish reccomended in backend?

- once you log in, get the cart AND groceries ( not just when you load browse)

- make a fire base folder with connection file and models?
