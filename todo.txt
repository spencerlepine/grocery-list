# To do: 
 - OpenSourceFood for searching and adding groceries
   - add grocery by scanning barcode
   - Basically fetch grocery data, then save a copy to user account
     - user can modify the data further based on their own use
   - https://www.npmjs.com/package/scandit-sdk-react
   
- Get UI idea from Yuka onboarding item form (price, name, category, price, serving price)

- Adding/Creating/Updating a grocery while app is loading up messes up the FetchLogic(it starts spamming groceries)

- add button going off right side of screen on mobile (LoadingSkeletons are larger than FoodCard cells)

- crop input images, don't smoosh em

- make youtube video

- fix csv? (Column headers are all messed up, images don't need to be saved)

- per ounce cost ratio

- audit npm packages and update everything
- go through each file and format, then make sure the code is sensible

- exact search goes to top (GRIDCOL1, GRIDROW1)?
