# To do:  
- go through each file and format, then make sure the code is sensible

- read warnings (prop types, un-unused variables)

- change quantity for cart

- duplication into cart (updating quantity feature)

- group categories on recommended page for easier browsing

- Password form is acting like username field (hide chars?)

- bug: reset the reloading boolean (any route change after form is used)

Upcoming features:
- Recipes (connected with ids)
- Pantry (see current items)
- Dynamically set categories
  - fetch grocieres on backend and return list of categories
- Longer passwords
  - deny weak invalid sign-ups, check email and password
- temporary loading boxes
- loading spinners (not just Empty Cart)
