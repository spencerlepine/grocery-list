# To do:
- make a fire base folder with connection file and models?



- Fetch the recommended each time the cart is updated
- fetch the something whenever the grocery is added from the form

- lock the navbar when you are not logged in?


- I can pass credentials to cookieParser and auth the fetch, but I have not found a way to pass ID of current user through body
- get groceries by accessing user -> userGroceries in user collection based on userID

- clean up old server controllers
- clean up client auth and dispatch stuff
- get rid of all localstorage

- get rid of old auth stuff
- get rid of demo
- group categories on recommended page for easier browsing

- add category function
